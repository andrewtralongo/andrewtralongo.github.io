        <p>Personalisation, digital manufacturing and mass production; these were the overarching themes asked to research. I was intrigued by the concept of turning the physical digital instead of the digital physical, and while beginning to brainstorm and develop initial ideas of what to research, I looked at my arms, my tattoos and was inspired: the concept of a tattoo. As the body can be considered as the ultimate mass produced object, furthermore body adornment in turn the most common form of personalisation, it seemed suitable to follow this stream of thought. Researching into digital tattoos, I came across QR code and RFID tattoos, small chips implanted beneath the skin. The first RFID tattoo contained a simple rainbow gradient gif which raises the question; is the chip considered to be the tattoo or the the gradient gif which it holds? Is the tattoo the QR code or the website it links to? If one couldn't access the internet or if it ceased to exist, would the tattoo? The ink or chip would still physically exist so what would it then represent? A mark of the existence of what once was or could have been? The concept of a digital presence, an avatar, a whole other realm of existence where the possibilities are endless. One which has quickly intertwined itself into the everyday, furthermore the consequences which have developed from it.</p>

        <p>The notion of personalisation, transformation and adornment has always existed within our culture. In the beginning many inscribed the body with symbols and glyphs for religious purposes, manipulating them in order to complete rituals and communicate to gods and spirits. Tattoos originated as a form of identification, and for sailors acted as a journal of their travels and worldly experiences. Although in this digital era, personalisation and adornment have transformed into the form of avatars, the representation of our digital-self; this could be something as simple as your Facebook profile picture or a whole blog which you post to once a day. This is not to say that the importance of traditional decor has diminished, yet the value of an avatar has quickly grown to carry an as equal significance. As it is easier to personalise your avatar to your desire, it has become the depiction of how we would like to be idealistically perceived. Our avatars are manufactured and designed instead of a depiction of our true selves.</p>
