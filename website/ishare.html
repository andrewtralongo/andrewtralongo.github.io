        <p>Personalisation, digital manufacturing and mass production; these were the overarching themes asked to research. I was intrigued by the concept of turning the physical digital instead of the digital physical, and while beginning to brainstorm and develop initial ideas of what to research, I looked at my arms, my tattoos and was inspired: the concept of a tattoo. As the body can be considered as the ultimate mass produced object, furthermore body adornment in turn the most common form of personalisation, it seemed suitable to follow this stream of thought. Researching into digital tattoos, I came across QR code and RFID tattoos, small chips implanted beneath the skin. The first RFID tattoo contained a simple rainbow gradient gif which raises the question; is the chip considered to be the tattoo or the the gradient gif which it holds? Is the tattoo the QR code or the website it links to? If one couldn't access the internet or if it ceased to exist, would the tattoo? The ink or chip would still physically exist so what would it then represent? A mark of the existence of what once was or could have been? The concept of a digital presence, an avatar, a whole other realm of existence where the possibilities are endless. One which has quickly intertwined itself into the everyday, furthermore the consequences which have developed from it.</p>

        <p>The notion of personalisation, transformation and adornment has always existed within our culture. In the beginning many inscribed the body with symbols and glyphs for religious purposes, manipulating them in order to complete rituals and communicate to gods and spirits. Tattoos originated as a form of identification, and for sailors acted as a journal of their travels and worldly experiences. Although in this digital era, personalisation and adornment have transformed into the form of avatars, the representation of our digital-self; this could be something as simple as your Facebook profile picture or a whole blog which you post to once a day. This is not to say that the importance of traditional decor has diminished, yet the value of an avatar has quickly grown to carry an as equal significance. As it is easier to personalise your avatar to your desire, it has become the depiction of how we would like to be idealistically perceived. Our avatars are manufactured and designed instead of a depiction of our true selves.</p>

        <p>We often feel the need to create, post and share to social media to show off our achievements in order to receive the praise and attention of others. In the Netflix series <em>Black Mirror</em>, every episode explores a world in which the digital has evolved so much that it has directly integrated into all aspects of the everyday, from a virtual reality feeling like true reality to the ability to record and watch back every moment and memory you have ever witnessed. One episode called <em>Nosedive</em> explores the concept of social media, a world where likes and ratings directly affect your socio-economic status. While trying to move into a better apartment and socialise with more popular people, the main character slowly becomes more and more obsessed with her rating that she ends up losing her mind and is cast away from society. While many of the episodes in this series imagine worlds with technologies far beyond our reach, this is one of the most realistic universes yet; a reality in which social media rules the world.</p><br>

        <p>FAT LAB experimented this importance of social media with their piece Social Roulette. Only taking 4 hours to fully produce, all you do is simply sign in to the site with your Facebook account and play Russian Roulette with your account. The only rules are that you must use your own account to play and only play once a day; if you lose, your account is deleted. It was inspired by two websites, one which would delete 1 to 10 of your Facebook friends on random and another which would ask you to delete 5 friends to get a free Whopper. During the short existence of Social Roulette’s life, 393 people participated. Theoretically 65 people should have died given the 1 in 6 odds yet all of them survived. Within 4 hours of the site’s launch, Facebook removed their API key access stopping the website from working and in the end, the website couldn’t actually delete your account. It was a performance disguised as a game. A comment on our digital identities and its ephemeral nature, that it can all be deleted within the blink of an eye. Highlighting the true importance that it possesses in our lives.</p>

        <p>With the intertwined nature of social media, this dependency has lead to a plethora of issues amongst society; technology has become so psychologically powerful that it doesn’t  change what we do, but who we are. We have become so addicted to the concept of receiving likes that it directly drives what we share online and therefore what we do in the everyday. Where we go for lunch. Who we see for a few drinks. What we choose our avatar to be, look and behave can all affect how others perceive you, and even change how you perceive yourself. If someone were to wear a black uniform, they would be seen as aggressive. On the contrary if they were to wear a white uniform, a symbol of piece. If you were to choose your avatar to wear this black uniform, others would naturally expect you to be hostile and troublesome. Even if you may not be, you may begin to abide to this stereotype as others may begin to fear and be weary of you solely based on these assumptions; this is called Behavioural Confirmation, where the expectations of the perceiver cause the target to behave in ways that conform to the perceiver’s expectations. This applies to the avatar as it is an entire self-representation over all forms of adornment and personalisation, not simply a piece of clothing. Although in an online presence, it is not as easy to know of the expectations and thoughts of others as the screen and text has replaced true face-to-face communication. Therefore the target begins to assume these presumptions during self-perception and begin to conform to the behaviour that they believe others would expect them to have, this called the Proteus Effect. We have become so obsessed to the perceptions, thoughts and ideals of others that it has begun to control us, who we are and how we act.

        <p>In being always connected and in communication with others, it has in turn made us isolated as a society. The ability to control who and how often we communicate with each other has caused us to fear simple face-to-face conversations. This fundamental social skill has become daunting to so many, triggering symptoms of anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. You cannot edit, delete or refine what you are going to say; you become your true self. Express your true feelings, thoughts and emotions. <em>“I’d rather text than talk”</em> shows that we have grown fear in humanity and self-confidence. We have learnt to expect more from technology and less from others. We’re lonely yet afraid of intimacy, designing the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to social media to escape not only from the world around us, but from ourselves. Our thoughts, our demons and our issues. The online has become the ideal realm of existence, and rather than trying to make the real world a happier one, we often escape to the digital to produce how we want to appear rather than how we truly do.</p>

        <p>In order to control this addiction and behaviour, for one 24 hour period in March every year since 2012, people in America have participated in National Day of Unplugging. A 24 hour digital detox. In 2014, one writer from The New Yorker, Casey N. Cep, criticised the entire purpose of this day, simply calling it <em>“pointless”</em>. Cep discusses how the concept of the real world is insidious, suggesting that the online presence, an avatar, isn’t authentic. It is meaningless and insignificant. <em>“Unplugging is the latest effort to escape the everyday.”</em> With how interconnected we are, it is difficult to imagine a world without the digital, often forgetting about the benefits of technology. Cep acknowledges her appreciation of these benefits by sharing an anecdote of how she found out about her grandmother’s death while travelling, and if not for the internet, would have missed the funeral and wouldn’t of known until her return. <em>“Unplugging from devices doesn’t stop us from experiencing our lives through their lenses, frames, and formats. We are only ever tourists in the land of no technology…”</em> Arguing that those who unplug don’t stay in this ‘land’ for very long and have every intention of returning, Cep’s argument is that we should reflect and consider how to live technology better rather than pretend to live without them for a day.</p>

        <p>In retaliation, Lindsay Holmes, a writer at Huffington Post, discusses how Cep has missed the whole point of this day; it is with every intention to return. The point to unplug is to escape and reconnect. As many forget that there was an existence before the internet, which has only been around for 30 years or so, unplugging is a way to disconnect and appreciate the technology which is available to us, therefore reflecting how to use it better. A way to acknowledge and begin to control this addiction, this behavioural change which has effected us to such a enormous degree over such a short period of time.</p>

        <p>While this dependency to a screen may be perceived as controlled behaviour, it can be compulsive, a chemical addiction. Research has shown that when you receive a notification, Dopamine is released in your system. This endorphin is a chemical released by neurons to send signals to other nerve cells, and with distinct dopamine pathways in the brain, it plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Many addictions increase dopamine activity, which is the cause of a ‘high’ and coincidently the comedown. Sharon Begley, the author of <em>Can’t Just Stop: An Investigation of Compulsions</em>, says that <em>“The emerging idea seems to be that when reality falls short, we feel a dopamine plunge. That feels bad, so we keep trying to do something that will make reality live up to expectations.”</em> We are constantly trying to make our lives seem better than they are through social media, by only sharing the best of the best. Through our avatar, creating an image rather than a reflection. Begley says that this rush isn’t the actual notification; it is in fact the anticipation of receiving one. The anticipation that your phone will light up and buzz, knowing that someone craves your attention as much as you crave theirs. She believes if we want to be less dependent on our devices that we need to identify the true source of our anxiety. We need to stop escaping into the digital.

        <p>In an interview, Begley has also shared her view on US President Donald Trump’s compulsive tweeting habit, explaining that she’d spoken to a number of psychiatrists and psychologists about his behaviour. With the sheer power and responsibility that Trump possesses, he is a clear representation of how important your digital presence can be. He expresses so many of his thoughts and statements through Twitter that his digital presence, his digital identity, has become the most well-known facet of his character. How can Cep label someone’s online presence as <em>“insignificant”</em> when there is such a powerful character like this currently sitting in the Oval Office? Begley additionally says that <em>“When he feels inferior for whatever reason - perhaps because he's comparing his inauguration crowds to the Women's March crowds - that seems to spur some anxiety in him, and it might compel his tweeting. He may alleviate his anxiety 140 characters at a time.”</em> He is known for his outrageous comments and since he knows that people are listening to him, maybe his digital life relieves him of his anxieties. Maybe we should feel sorry for him? He has had such a hard life after all…

        <p>While Trump uses his digital identity to speak his mind, his digital presence has done nothing but aid his controversial voice and opinion to the world. Twitter constantly used as a tool for a political agenda, the 2016 election. It can however be used more artistically yet still as controversial to those with the same degree of interested. In 2015, a band named The 1975 highly took advantage of social media to promote the anticipation of their second album, <em>I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it.</em></p>

        <p>With each release, including their first four EPs, the band have had a distinctive personality and sound to them. Their EPs and debut self-titled album are alternative-rock in nature. Associated with a traditional monochromatic-grunge aesthetic, they express this style across all mediums, from their social media posts to their live sets. In the music video for their pop track <em>Girls</em>, it begins with the frontman, Matthew Healy, and the drummer, George Daniel, both whom are majorly responsible for the band’s artistic expression and direction, discussing;</p>

        <p>This clip is shown in black and white, a quick flash of the logo and then the music begins. The video is filmed in colour and shot like a stereotypical pop music video: Fast sharp cuts. The singer placed behind pastel coloured walls mouthing lines in each chorus. Close up shots of the guitarists and bass player strumming the catchy melody. The singer throughout the entire music video looking quite fed up with the tone of the video, as if he had no creative control over it. This is not the case and the video acts as a commentary of the over commercialisation of pop music and the lack of any <em>“heart and soul”</em> in music that has been designed to be a hit instead of a true artistic expression. This thought mirroring that of the avatar. The lack of truth and realism, instead the creation and depiction of a paradise.</p>

            <p><b>Matthew</b><br>Hey! This is the era of reflection right? We’ve killed the rockstars. Just another casualty in the war against popular art- butchered by our postmodern reflective propensities and selfie awareness. Our projected rendered identity needs to change not only visually but philosophically. -How do you do that? Firstly we must reclaim our identity &amp; repossess our control of it. It’s simple. You could say it’s black &amp; white until then there won’t be any pop music or dancing with long hair. “You can’t do that” I hear you say, “That’s ours!” Correct!
            The hardest part of any relationship is to say ‘Goodbye’.<br>
            As much as we might like things to stay the same, change is an inevitable part of life. We can’t simply go on forever - always staying the same, never evolving.<br>
            So we must leave. With a parting ‘We love you’ - we are already gone.<br>
            Thank You<br>
            The 1975.<br>
            <br>
            Camerado, I give you my hand. I give you my love more precious than money.</p>

        <p>The next day, they simply posted the cover of their next album. Although during this time of absence, their fanbase went absolutely mental, thinking that the band had split up and would never return, when in fact had been reborn. Their image had evolved into a new aesthetic. It opened them into a world of colour: A gradient of red to blue for their single <em>She’s American</em>. Rotating glass prisms dispersing light for their elegant 6 minute instrumental track <em>I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it</em>. A simple rainbow for <em>Loving Someone</em>. A shocking pink overtone to mark this era.</p><br>

        <p>With their third album expected to drop in the next year, they are going through a similar phase of reimagining themselves via social media. As the album is titled after one of the band’s previous names, additionally the same name of their last EP, Music For Cars, they seem to be returning to their original dramatised-grunge aesthetic. Once again being reborn through social media, they have posted a video of the album cover’s colour flickering away and every image since has been posted in black and white.

The technology has evolved so rapidly and integrated itself within the everyday that we cannot deny its existence nor the responsibility which we have to control its addiction, how it is changing us as people. As a society. The ephemeral nature of the digital has such a lasting impression on the physical that both are now forever intertwined. The duality of the digital avatar versus our ‘real’ identity, manufacturing our image. We must accept reality and stop escaping.</p>
