                <h2>The Client</h2><br>
                <p>Aesop uses botanical products that aren’t tested on animals, however this is not stated anywhere on their products. They have chosen to hide this information based on a lack of clarity concerning the word Botanic. They deliberately don’t use color categorisation in most of their product design and the common aesthetic utilised is uniform and minimal.<br><br>
                Their shop designs vary from store to store and city to city. However, certain aspects of design seem to be consistent throughout: Smell — all their stores have an amazing aroma that varies from store to store. Materials — the design and use of different materials is prominent, such as wood, cement, brass, glass, ceramics. Shelving with all their products on display that is rotated and changed on a continual basis. Extremely helpful staff members willing to explain and guide you through the Aesop experience.<br><br>
                Helpfull staff seems to be paramount to their brand identity. We know the staff move the products around every 2-3 weeks so that if a client comes back for more of the same product, then they can’t just go back to where they picked it up from, they still have to consult with a staff member. So for both new customers, confused as to what to buy — or what Aesop is — and returning customers, the staff are always there to help and guide.</p>

               <h2>Our Interpretation</h2><br>
                <p>After field research we can interpret two fundamental experiences in the Aesop ecology; an intimate client relation offering a prescription service and confusion on the part of the customer both returning and new.<br><br>
                After we spoke with various members of staff, we ascertained that most customers when first entering the store felt confused — confused as the what Aesop was and confused as to where to find the products they wanted.<br><br>
                It’s not the type of store one can easily browse around. This temporary confusion is then clarified by members of staff. So we know that an installation can not take away from the staff experience of the store and can not clarify product information. Thus we are left with confusion or ambiguity and olfaction being elements to work with when creating a digital User Experience.

               <h2>Our Goal</h2><br>
                <p>Our proposal is to make an installation that uses both smell and memory to create an Aesop experience, an in-store experience that runs in the parallel to the customer journey already established. Consisting of a digital mirror and a smell lab setup, the digital mirror will use a Microsoft Kinect camera which will record the user's distance relative to the screen and modifying the image in accordance. The closer the user is to the mirror, the more the mirror-image pixel-separates, outputting this through a crystal covered display.<br><br>
                As the user walks towards the mirror, instructions will appear, instructing the user to close their eyes and try to recall a memory that the smell invokes. Below the mirror is an installation consisting of beakers and multiple laboratory apparatus. One of the apparatus is a box with a fan inside blowing air through a gauze that contains various artifacts i.e. Vanilla. The smell to recall a memory. This isolated experience is a small yet effective addition to the Aesop customer journey.
